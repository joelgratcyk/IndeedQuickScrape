# IndeedQuickScrape
Python Code to Do A Quick Scrape of Indeed Jobs

This is a hobby project with the goal od learning Python and web scraping. 

Indeed and other wbesites may have TOS that prohibit web scraping. Please respect thier policies. 

The example URL used on Line 7 is for Jobs in Chicago, IL that are less than 7 days old, with a radius of 0. 

Still having an issue with Lines 34 & 35 sometimes grabbing the correct information as intended and sometimes grabbing the same information as eachother. A bug to work out later. 

Jobs are output to "IndeedQuickScrapeJobsOutput.csv". You can change this to any name you prefer. Find it on Line 50. 

Use this code at your own risk. It does not come with any warranty expressed or implied. 

This script is based off of the code in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=070e7nMYt6c) by PythonEatsSQuirreL.
